Description: Statistical tools based on the probabilistic properties of the 
    record occurrence in a sequence of independent and identically distributed 
    continuous random variables. In particular, tools to prepare a time series 
    as well as distribution-free trend and change-point tests and graphical 
    tools to study the record occurrence.
