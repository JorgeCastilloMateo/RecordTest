The R package *RecordTest* provides exploratory data analysis and inference tools based on theory of records to describe the record occurrence and detect trends and change-points in time series. In particular, *RecordTest* consists of graphical tools, distribution-free tests for trend in location, variation or non-stationarity in the tails, and change-point detection tests, all of them based on the record occurrence.
