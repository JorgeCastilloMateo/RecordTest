\description{
A dataset containing the series of daily maximum temperature at 
  Zaragoza aeropuerto (Spain), from 01/01/1951 to 31/12/2020. Zaragoza is 
  located at the north-east (+41:39:42 N, -001:00:29 W) of Iberian Peninsula
  at 247 m above mean sea level. This series is obtained from the ECA&D 
  series but it has been transformed, by removing days February
  29th and imputing the three missing values in the original series (by
  exponential weighted moving average expanded four days to each side). The
  variables are the following:

\itemize{
  \item STAID : Station identifier
  \item SOUID : Source identifier
  \item DATE  : Date YYYYMMDD
  \item TX    : Maximum temperature in 0.1 ÂºC
  \item Q_TX  : quality code for TX (0='valid'; 1='suspect'; 9='missing')
}
