\description{
A dataset containing the series of daily maximum temperature at 
  Zaragoza aeropuerto (Spain), from 01/01/1951 to 31/12/2020. Zaragoza is 
  located at the north-east (+41:39:42 N, -001:00:29 W) of Iberian Peninsula
  at 247 m above mean sea level. This series is obtained from the ECA&D 
  series but it has been transformed, by removing days February
  29th. The series has three \code{NA} missing observations corresponding 
  to 31/03/1951, 04/01/1965, and 05/10/1965. The variables are the 
  following:

\itemize{
  \item STAID : Station identifier
  \item SOUID : Source identifier
  \item DATE  : Date YYYYMMDD
  \item TX    : Maximum temperature in 0.1ÂºC
  \item Q_TX  : quality code for TX (0='valid'; 1='suspect'; 9='missing')
}
