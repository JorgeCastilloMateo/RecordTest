"upper" or "lower".}

\description{
This function performs score (or Lagrange multiplier) tests
  for the likelihood of the record indicators \eqn{I_t} to study the 
  hypothesis of the classical record model (i.e., of IID continuous RVs).
}
\details{
The null hypothesis of the score tests is that in every vector 
  (columns of the matrix \code{X}), the probability of record at 
  time \eqn{t} is \eqn{1/t} as in the classical record model, and 
  the alternative depends on the \code{alternative} and \code{probabilities}
  arguments. The probability at time \eqn{t} is any value, but equal in the
  \eqn{M} series if \code{probabilities = "equal"}  or different in the 
  \eqn{M} series if \code{probabilities = "different"}. The alternative 
  hypothesis is more specific in the first case than in the second one.
  Furthermore, the \code{"two.sided"} \code{alternative} is tested with 
  the usual Lagrange multiplier statistic, while the one-sided 
  \code{alternatives} use specific statistics based on scores. 
  (See Cebrián, Castillo-Mateo and Asín (2022) for details on these tests.)

  If \code{alternative = "two.sided" & probabilities = "equal"}, under the
  null, the Lagrange multiplier statistic has an asymptotic \eqn{\chi^2} 
  distribution with \eqn{T-1} degrees of freedom. It has been seen that for
  the approximation to be adequate \eqn{M} should be greater than \eqn{T}. 
  Otherwise, a \code{simulate.p.value} can be computed.
  
  If \code{alternative = "two.sided" & probabilities = "different"}, the 
  asymptotic behaviour of the Lagrange multiplier statistic is not 
  fulfilled, but the Monte Carlo approach to simulate the p-value is 
  applied.
  
  If \code{alternative} is one-sided and \code{probabilities = "equal"},
  the statistic of the test is
  \deqn{\mathcal{T} = \sum_{t=2}^T \frac{(t S_t-M)^2}{M(t-1)} I_{\{S_t > M/t\}}.}
  The p-value of this test is estimated with Monte Carlo simulations,
  since the compute the exact distribution of \eqn{\mathcal{T}} is very 
  expensive.   
  
  If \code{alternative} is one-sided and \code{probabilities = "different"},
  the statistic of the test is
  \deqn{\mathcal{S} = \frac{\sum_{t=2}^T t (t S_t - M) / (t - 1)}{\sqrt{M \sum_{t=2}^T t^2 / (t - 1)}},}
  which is asymptotically standard normal distributed in \eqn{M}. It is 
  equivalent to the statistic of the weighted number of records 
  \code{\link{N.test}} with weights \eqn{\omega_t = t^2 / (t-1)}  
  \eqn{(t=2,\ldots,T)}.
