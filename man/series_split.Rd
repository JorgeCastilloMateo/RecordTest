\title{Splitted series}
\usage{
series_split(X, Mcols = 365)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric vector.}

\item{Mcols}{An integer number, giving the number of columns in the 
final matrix.}
}
\value{
A matrix with \code{Mcols} columns.
}
\description{
The vector \code{X} of length \eqn{T} is broken into 
  \code{Mcols} blocks, each part containing \eqn{T/\code{Mcols}} elements.

  If the vector \code{X} represents consecutive daily values, e.g., and then 
  \code{Mcols = 365} is preferred; this function rearranges \code{X} into a 
  matrix format, where each column is the vector of values at the same day 
  of the year. If it were monthly data it would be preferred, e.g., 
  \code{Mcols = 12}.
}
\details{
This function is used in the data preparation (or pre-processing) 
  often required to apply the record inference tools in this package.

  This function transforms a vector into a matrix, applying the 
  following procedure: the first row of the matrix is made up of the first 
  \code{Mcols} elements of the vector, the second row by the \code{Mcols} 
  following elements, and so on.
  The length of the vector must be a multiple of \code{Mcols} 
  (see Note otherwise).

  In the case of a vector of daily values, \code{Mcols} is usually 365,
  so that the first column corresponds to all the values observed at the  
  1st of January, the second to the 2nd of January, etc.

  If \eqn{X_{i,j}} represents the value in day \eqn{j} of year \eqn{i}, then if
  \deqn{\code{X} = (X_{1,1},X_{1,2},\ldots,X_{1,365},X_{2,1},X_{2,2},\ldots,X_{T,365}),}
  applying \code{splitSeries} to \code{X} returns the following matrix:
  \deqn{
  \left( \begin{array}{cccc}
       X_{1,1} & X_{1,2} & \cdots & X_{1,365} \\ 
       X_{2,1} & X_{2,2} & \cdots & X_{2,365} \\
       \vdots & \vdots &  & \vdots \\
       X_{T,1} & X_{T,2} & \cdots & X_{T,365}
       \end{array} \right)_{T \times 365}. 
  }
}
\note{
\code{\link{series_double}} can be implemented for the same purpose as 
  this function but without requiring that the length of \code{X} be 
  divisible by \code{Mcols}. It removes the first elements of \code{X} until
  its length is divisible by \code{Mcols}.
