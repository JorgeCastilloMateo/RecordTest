\title{Breaking Record Ties}
\usage{
series_untie(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric vector, matrix (or data frame).}
}
\value{
A matrix equal to \code{X} whose elements have been added a 
  sample from a uniform variable, different for each element.
}
\description{
Breaks record ties when observations have been rounded.
}
\details{
This function is used in the data preparation (or pre-processing) 
 often required to apply the exploratory and inference tools based on 
 theory of records within this package.
 
 The theory of records on which the hypothesis tests are based assumes 
 that the random variables are continuous, so that the probability 
 that two observations take the same value is zero. Most of the data 
 collected is rounded, giving a certain probability to the tie between 
 records, thereby reducing the number of new records (see, e.g., Wergen 
 et al. 2012). 
 
 This function breaks ties by adding a uniform random variable 
 to each element of \code{X}. The function computes the maximum number of 
 decimal digits (let it be \eqn{n}) for any element in \code{X}. Then the
 uniform variable is sampled in the interval 
 \eqn{(-5 \times 10^{-(n+1)}, 5 \times 10^{-(n+1)})}, so the records in the
 original (rounded) series are also records in the new series.
