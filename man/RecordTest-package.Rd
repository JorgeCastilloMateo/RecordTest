\title{\strong{RecordTest}: A Package for Testing the Classical Record Model}
\description{
\strong{RecordTest} provides data preparation, exploratory data 
  analysis and inference tools based on theory of records to describe the 
  record occurrence and detect trends, change-points or non-stationarities 
  in the tails of the time series.

\details{
The Classical Record Model:

  Record statistics are used primarily to quantify the stochastic behaviour
  of a process at never-seen-before values, either upper or lower. The setup
  of independent and identically distibuted (IID) continuous random 
  variables (RVs), often called the classical record model, is 
  particularly interesting because the common continuous distribution 
  underlying the IID continuous RVs will not affect the distribution of the variables 
  relative to the record occurrence.  
  Many fields have begun to use the theory of records to study these 
  remarkable events. Particularly productive is the study of 
  record-breaking temperatures and their connection with climate change, 
  but also records in other environmental fields (precipitations, floods, 
  earthquakes, etc.), economy, biology, physics or even sports have been 
  analysed.
  See Arnold, Balakrishnan and Nagaraja (1998) for an extensive theoretical
  introduction to the theory of records and in particular the classical 
  record model. See Foster and Stuart (1954), Diersen and Trenkler (1996, 
  2001) and Cebrián, Castillo-Mateo and Asín (2022) for the 
  distribution-free trend detection tests and Castillo-Mateo (2022) for the
  distribution-free change-point detection tests based on the classical 
  record model. For an easy introduction to \strong{RecordTest} use 
  \code{vignette("RecordTest")}.

  This package provides tests to study the hypothesis of the classical 
  record model, that is that the record occurrence from a series of values 
  observed at regular time units come from an IID series of continuous RVs. 
  If we have sequences of independent variables with no seasonal component,
  the hypothesis of IID variables is equivalent to test the hypothesis of 
  homogeneity and stationarity.

  The functions in the data preparation step:
  
  The functions admit a vector \code{X} corresponding to a single series as
  an argument. However, some situations could take advantage of having 
  \eqn{M} uncorrelated vectors to infer from the sample. Then, the input of
  the functions to perform the statistical tools can be a matrix \code{X} 
  where each column corresponds to a vector formed by the values of a 
  series \eqn{X_t}, for \eqn{t=1,\ldots,T}, so that each row of the matrix
  correspond to a time \eqn{t}.

  In  many real problems, such as those related to environmental phenomena, 
  the series of variables to analyse show a seasonal behaviour, and only one
  realisation is available. In order to be able to apply the suggested tools
  to detect the existence of a trend, the seasonal component has to be 
  removed and a sample of \eqn{M} uncorrelated series should be obtained. 
  Those problems can be solved by preparing the data adequately. 
  A wide set of tools to carry out a preliminary analysis and to prepare 
  data with a seasonal pattern are implemented in the following functions.
  
  \code{\link{series_record}}: If only the record times are available.
  
  \code{\link{series_split}}, \code{\link{series_double}}: To split the
  series in several subseries and remove the seasonal component and 
  autocorrelation.
  
  \code{\link{series_uncor}}: To extract a subset of uncorrelated subseries 
  
  \code{\link{series_ties}}, \code{\link{series_untie}}: To deal with record
  ties.
  
  \code{\link{series_rev}}: To study the series backwards.

  The functions to compute the record statistics are:
  
  \code{\link{I.record}}: Computes the observed record indicators. \code{NA} 
  values are taken as no records unless they appear at \eqn{t = 1}.
  
  \code{\link{N.record}}, \code{\link{Nmean.record}}: Compute the observed
  number of records up to time \eqn{t}.
  
  \code{\link{S.record}}: Computes the observed number of records at every
  time \eqn{t}, using \eqn{M} series.
  
  \code{\link{p.record}}: Computes the estimated record probability at every
  time \eqn{t}, using \eqn{M} series.
  
  \code{\link{L.record}}: Computes the observed record times.
  
  \code{\link{R.record}}: Computes the observed record values.
  
  The functions to compute the tests:
  
  All the tests performed are distribution-free/non-parametric tests in 
  time series for trend, change-point and non-stationarity in the extremes 
  of the distribution based on the null hypothesis that the record 
  indicators are independent and the probabilities of record at time \eqn{t}
  are \eqn{p_t = 1 / t}. 
  
  \code{\link{change.point}}: Implements Castillo-Mateo change-point tests.
  
  \code{\link{foster.test}}: Implements Foster-Stuart and Diersen-Trenkler
  trend tests. 
  
  \code{\link{N.test}}: Implements tests based on the (weighted) number of
  records.
  
  \code{\link{brown.method}}: Brown's method to combine dependent p-values 
  from \code{\link{N.test}}.
  
  \code{\link{fisher.method}}: General function to apply Fisher's method to
  independent p-values.
  
  \code{\link{p.regression.test}}: Implements a regression test based on the
  record probabilities.
  
  \code{\link{p.chisq.test}}: Implements a \eqn{\chi^2}-test based on the 
  record probabilities.
  
  \code{\link{lr.test}}: Implements likelihood ratio tests based on the 
  record indicators.
  
  \code{\link{score.test}}: Implements score or Lagrange multiplier
  tests based on the record indicators.

  The functions to compute the graphical tools:
  
  \code{\link{records}}: Shows the series remarking its records.
  
  \code{\link{L.plot}}: Shows record times in several series.
  
  \code{\link{foster.plot}}: Shows plots based on Foster-Stuart and
  Diersen-Trenkler statistics.
  
  \code{\link{N.plot}}: Shows the (weighted) number of records.
   
  \code{\link{p.plot}}: Shows the record probabilities in different plots.

  All the tests and graphical tools can be applied to both upper and lower 
  records in the forward and backward directions.
  
  Other functions:
  
  \code{\link{rcrm}}: Random generation for the classical record model.
  
  \code{\link{dpoisbinom}}, \code{\link{ppoisbinom}}, 
  \code{\link{qpoisbinom}}, \code{\link{rpoisbinom}}: Density, distribution
  function, quantile function and random generation for the Poisson binomial
  distribution. Related to the probability distribution function of the 
  number of records under the null hypothesis.
  
  Example datasets:

  There are two example datasets included with this package. It is possible
  to load these datasets into R using the \code{data} function. The 
  datasets have their own help file, which can be accessed by 
  \code{help([dataset_name])}. 
  Data included with \strong{RecordTest} are:
  
  \code{\link{TX_Zaragoza}} - Daily maximum temperatures at Zaragoza 
  (Spain).
  
  \code{\link{ZaragozaSeries}} - Split and uncorrelated subseries 
  \code{\link{TX_Zaragoza}$TX}.
  
  \code{\link{Olympic_records_200m}} - 200-meter Olympic records from 1900
  to 2020.
