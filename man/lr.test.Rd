\description{
This function performs likelihood-ratio tests
  for the likelihood of the record indicators \eqn{I_t} to study the 
  hypothesis of the classical record model (i.e., of IID continuous RVs).
}
\details{
The null hypothesis of the likelihood-ratio tests is that in every vector 
  (columns of the matrix \code{X}), the probability of record at 
  time \eqn{t} is \eqn{1 / t} as in the classical record model, and 
  the alternative depends on the \code{alternative} and \code{probabilities}
  arguments. The probability at time \eqn{t} is any value, but equal in the
  \eqn{M} series if \code{probabilities = "equal"}  or different in the 
  \eqn{M} series if \code{probabilities = "different"}. The alternative 
  hypothesis is more specific in the first case than in the second one.
  Furthermore, the \code{"two.sided"} \code{alternative} is tested with 
  the usual likelihood ratio statistic, while the one-sided 
  \code{alternatives} use specific statistics based on likelihoods
  (see Cebrián, Castillo-Mateo and Asín, 2021, for the details).

  If \code{alternative = "two.sided" & probabilities = "equal"}, under the
  null, the likelihood ratio statistic has an asymptotic \eqn{\chi^2} 
  distribution with \eqn{T-1} degrees of freedom. It has been seen that for
  the approximation to be adequate \eqn{M} must be between 4 and 5 times 
  greater than \eqn{T}. Otherwise, a \code{simulate.p.value} is recommended.
  
  If \code{alternative = "two.sided" & probabilities = "different"}, the 
  asymptotic behaviour is not fulfilled, but the Monte Carlo approach to 
  simulate the p-value is applied. This statistic is the same as \eqn{\ell} 
  below multiplied by a factor of 2, so the p-value is the same.
  
  If \code{alternative} is one-sided and \code{probabilities = "equal"},
  the statistic of the test is
  \deqn{-2 \sum_{t=2}^T \left\{-S_t \log\left(\frac{tS_t}{M}\right)+(M-S_t)\left( \log\left(1-\frac{1}{t}\right) - \log\left(1-\frac{S_t}{M}\right) I_{\{S_t<M\}} \right) \right\} I_{\{S_t > M/t\}}.}
  The p-value of this test is estimated with Monte Carlo simulations,
  because the computation of its exact distribution is very expensive.   
  
  If \code{alternative} is one-sided and \code{probabilities = "different"},
  the statistic of the test is
  \deqn{\ell = \sum_{t=2}^T  S_{t} \log(t-1) - M \log\left(1-\frac{1}{t}\right).}
  The p-value of this test is estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. 
  However, it is equivalent to the statistic of the weighted number of 
  records \code{\link{N.test}} with weights \eqn{\omega_t = \log(t-1)} 
  \eqn{(t=2,\ldots,T)}.
